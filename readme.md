# Coinbase API application Backend

# What is this?
- This is the backend to application I am creating that will use all of coinbases 3rd party API's for real time market data, as well as an attempt to make it easier for newer traders to interface with when it comes to putting in stop losses or buy orders

- This is also my first attempt at a clean ASP.NET architechture so this will be a learning process for me.

# Usage
- More to come later. However this is not intended for use by others
